# Basic Info Site - Using Node.js

This is a simple website that is meant to test my understanding of Node.js

## Overview

A server is created on port 8080. The server first takes the user's request in order to determine which file to serve. This file is then read and sent to the user with the correct formatting. If there is no such file, a 404 page is sent instead.

### What I Learned

I learned how to create a server object, start a server on a specific port. I also learned to take a user's request, parse it in order to ascertain which page or resource the user wants and serve the correct page.
